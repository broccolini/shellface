        Michelle has over 11 years event and marketing experience, having worked in the government, performing arts, tourism and not-for-profit sectors before landing at Milk. Michelle holds a Masters Degree in Management majoring in Event Management from the University of Technology, Sydney and a Bachelor of Business in Human Resources from the Australian Catholic University. If she’s not at work, you might find her eating, hanging out with llamas on the side of a mountain, scuba diving, watching live performances or trying to do the moonwalk. Possibly all at the same time.

          Michelle is currently Milk’s events producer, where she gets to backflip ninja-style to create event experiences with exceedingly detailed schedules and a phone hanging around her neck.
